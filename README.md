## hiding your API keys and tokens
examples of how to hide api keys, examples using python import, json, yaml and environmental variables

## using .gitignore
Note: my example has the config files commented out so I can include them here.  Would be ignored in real usage
```
config.py   <- these are the config files that hold the api keys or tokens
config.json
config.yml
config.py
__init__.py
__pycache__
.ipynb_checkpoints
Untitled*.ipynb
```
